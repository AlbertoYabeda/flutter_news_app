# News App

- This is the project I built to learn how to fetch data to an api in flutter.

- The main goal for this mini project was to understand how a flutter app works with API's
and not so much about the UI because I already got some basics concepts.

## Steps I followed to built it
- get the URL from newsapi.org
- get the data comming from the api.
- convert the json received into a dart object
- return the dart object to the UI
- get the dart object and showing the data on the UI.

- So, here's how the app looks like.
